## Customization

### Adding New Cities
Edit the `datalist` in `index.html`:
```html
<datalist id="cities-list">
    <option value="Your City"></option>
    <!-- Add more cities here -->
</datalist>
```

### Changing Form Fields
Modify the form in `index.html` and update the validation in both frontend and backend.

### Styling
The form uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the CSS classes.

## Data Storage

Leads are stored in `leads.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
  "leads": [
    {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "phone": "+91 1234567890",
      "city": "Mumbai",
      "gender": "male",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "source": "instagram_ad",
      "submittedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- The current setup is for prototyping
- For production, consider:
  - Adding authentication to admin dashboard
  - Using a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
  - Implementing rate limiting
  - Adding HTTPS
  - Input sanitization and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, change it in `server.js`:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;  // Change to 3001 or another port
```

### CORS Issues
The server includes CORS middleware. If you're still having issues, check your browser's developer console.

### Data Not Saving
Ensure the `leads.json` file is writable and the server has proper permissions.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure the server is running
4. Check file permissions
