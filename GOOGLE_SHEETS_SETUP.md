## üîß Troubleshooting

### If the form doesn't submit to Google Sheets:

1. **Check the script URL** is correct and ends with `/exec`
2. **Verify the script is deployed** as a web app with "Anyone" access
3. **Check the browser console** for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
4. **Test with the test page** first (`test-google-sheets.html`)

### If you get authorization errors:

1. **Make sure the script is deployed** with "Anyone" access
2. **Check that you authorized** the app when deploying
3. **Try redeploying** the script
4. **Clear browser cache** and try again

### If data doesn't appear in Google Sheets:

1. **Check the Apps Script execution log**:
   - Go to Apps Script editor
   - Click "Executions" in the left sidebar
   - Check for any errors
2. **Verify the spreadsheet is open** when testing
3. **Run the `setupSheet` function** again
4. **Check if the sheet name is "Leads"** or use the active sheet

### Common Error Messages:

- **"No spreadsheet found"**: Make sure you have a Google Sheet open
- **"Missing required fields"**: Check that all form fields are being sent
- **"Network Error"**: Check your internet connection and script URL
- **"CORS Error"**: This is normal for Google Apps Script, the form should still work
